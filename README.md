### Design Choices Explained

- **React & TypeScript**: We chose React for its fast rendering capabilities and TypeScript to catch errors early and ensure code reliability. Together, they make the development process smoother and more robust.  
- **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS was used for styling to keep the design simple and adaptable while maintaining full control over the visual appearance.  
- **State Management**: React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are used to handle state, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.  
- **Reusable Components**: The interface is divided into smaller, reusable pieces. This approach keeps the code organized and allows for easier updates or additions in the future.
